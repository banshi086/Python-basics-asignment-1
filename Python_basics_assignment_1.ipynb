        "1-What is python and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        " 2-What is an interpreter in python\n",
        " -interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages.Python uses an interpreter to process the code line-by-line.\n",
        " 3-What are pre define keywords in python\n",
        "  -pre define keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes. These keywords are part of Python's syntax and cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
        "4-can key words be used as variable names\n",
        " -No\n",
        "\n",
        "5-What is mutability in pyton\n",
        " -It can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6-Why are lists mutable but tuples are immutable\n",
        " -Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. Lists are mutable, meaning their content can be changed, while tuples are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7-What is the difference between\"==\" and \"is\" operator in python\n",
        " -\"==\" is comparative operator\n",

        " 9-What is typecasting in python\n",
        " -Typecasting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type into another\n",
        "\n",
        "10-What are the difference between implicity and explicity type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        " -implicit Type Casting is automatic, and Python takes care of it when it knows no data will be lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Explicit Type Casting is manual and is used when the programmer needs to explicitly convert one type to another using built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11-What is the purpose of conditional statements in python\n",
        "\n",
        "-The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "12-How does the elif statement works\n",
        "\n",
        " -The elif statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. If the if condition is False, it checks the condition in the elif block. If the elif condition is True, it executes the corresponding code.\n",
        "13-What is the different between for and while loops\n",
        "\n",
        " -the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range) when the number of iterations is known or fixed. It is ideal for situations where you need to loop through elements of an iterable. The while loop, on the other hand, continues as long as a specified condition is True and is used when the number of iterations is not predetermined. While the for loop works with iterables, the while loop depends on a condition that is evaluated before each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14-Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than for loops.\n",
        "  -number = -1\n",

        "\n",
        "print(\"You entered a valid positive number:\", number)\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the while loop keeps asking for input until the user provides a positive number. Since the number of attempts is unknown, a while loop is better than a for loop in this case.\n",
